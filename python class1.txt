Important Points:-
1.Python is simple because of easy syntax.
2.Python is very popular because of rich library assert.
3.python is free and open source.
4.Python is interpreter (it analyse and execute line by line) to run the program
5.Python supports procedure oriented porgramming(POP),Object oriented programmming(OOP)and lambda Functions.
6.Python programming also called as a scripting language.
7.Python is extensible and embidable.
8.In Python everything is represented in object.
9.Python will run Equally on different paltform like windows.linux, unix etc.
=================================================================================================
To view list of Keywords
import keyword  >>>>>here import is a keyword and keyword is a module(any.py file is called as module) 
print(keyword.kwlist)>>>>>>>>>>>>print is function and kwlist is variable.
-------------or-----------
import keyword as kk>>>>>>>>>>here kk is a alilis name of keyword
print(kk.kwlist)
=================================================================================================
Identifiers :-
it is a name given to an entity like class, function/method,variable.
Class:-is a collection of variables and functions.
Function/method:- function is a collection of statements which perform an operation.
Variable:-the above two are not matching it is variable. 
>>>identifiers must begin with alphabet or underscore(_).
>>>identifier can have small atoz,capital AtoZ,0to9 and (_)
>>>identifier should not match with Keywords
>>>Wide space is not allowed.
Example:- 
idno
id_no        idno_        1idno                 _1_          _                __               import          Import       True           true      id no      id_no    Id1no


===================================================================================
Variable:-
it is a named memory location which holds some data.
>>> The variables are dynamic type which means the type of  variable which are decided at runtime.
Syntax:-
variable name=value
Ex:-idno=100
x=100
print(x)
Output:- 100
a="bunny"
print(a)
Output:-bunny
b=0606
print(b)
Output:-0606
=================================================================================
One more example of Variable
a=143
print(a)    #143                                           # it means comment in #(hashtag) we can write expected output which is not exceed morethan one line

print(type(a))   #<class 'int'>

a="Bunny"
print(a)  #"Bunny"
print(type(a))     #<class 'str'>
